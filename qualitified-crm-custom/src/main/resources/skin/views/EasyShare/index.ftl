<div>
<p>
This is the view corresponding to your root object: ${This.class.simpleName}.
</p>

<p>
You can find the code of this view in: src/main/resources/skin/views/${This.class.simpleName}
</p>

<p>
To render a view from an WebEngine object you should create @GET annotated method which is returning the view: getView("viewname") where <i>viewname</i> is the file name (without the ftl extension) in the views/ObjectName folder.   
</p>

<p>
In a view you can access the object instance owning the view using ${r"${This}"} variable or the request context using the ${r"${Context}"} variable.  
</p>

<p>
Also, you can use @block statements to create reusable layouts.
